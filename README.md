# CHAINSTACK TEST

The current repository allows you to listen pending transactions from a given network mempool (in its hash format) and outputs the hashes through console.

### Default networks

We've added some default networks in case you want to try this program quickly: **BSC, ETHEREUM AND POLYGON**. Although you can still add your own network rpc in case you need it. Please consider using just Websockets (wss) rpcs for this version, as HTTPS connections will likely fail.

### Instructions

Clone this repository and go to the project folder:

`git clone https://github.com/yieniggu/chainstack-test.git  
  && cd chainstack-test`

#### In case you want to test this program quickly and select one of the given default networks, select it from the list:

#### If you prefer to use your own custom rpc endpoint open the .env file and replace the CUSTOM_NODE value with the rpc you want to use. Remember to provide a websocket endpoint format:

#### Once you have selected your prefered rpc, you'll start seeing the transaction hashes from the mempool!
